This three week long bootcamp is designed to take you from little/no computational experience to bioinformatic literacy. At the end of this course you will:

- Navigate the Linux operating system and the command line interface (CLI)
- Write BASH and Python scripts
- Construct basic bioinformatic pipelines for data analysis
- Know how find, interpret and download reference genomes
- Understand the basics of genome assembly and sequence alignment
- Be able to detect variants in DNA sequences using a reference genome
- Perform a simple differential expression analysis on RNAseq data
- Submit jobs to a supercomputer

From July 5th to July 27th we will meet from 9-5 (two three hour sessions with break for lunch) Monday through Friday. The bootcamp will culminate in the INBRE Summer Research Symposium held on July 27th.
